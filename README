Virtualbricks
=============

Virtualbricks is a frontend for the management of Qemu Virtual Machines
(VMs) and VDE virtualized network devices (switches, channel emulators,
etc.). Although it can be used to manage isolated VMs, its peculiar aim
is to design and manage testbeds consisting of many VMs interconnected
by VDE elements. In other words, it allows to extend the concept of VM
to testbeds, which thanks to Virtualbricks can become entirely
software-defined.

Installation
============

Virtualbricks is installable with pip but it won't work. Virtualbricks
depends on pygtk and pygtk is not installable via pip. The first
solution is to install pygtk from your distribution's packages and to
install Virtualbricks with pip::

    pip install --user .

The second solution is to install Virtualbricks from the DEB or RPM
packages. Available soon.
